`pytest-optimized-parametrization`

---

This repository contains a solution to optimize the test parametrization process in pytest, specifically addressing performance issues that arise in large test suites with numerous tests and fixtures. By implementing a filtering mechanism within the `pytest_generate_tests` hook, this solution ensures that only the relevant tests matching specified markers or keywords are parametrized, significantly reducing unnecessary overhead and improving overall test execution performance.

### Key Features

- **Efficient Parametrization**: Dynamically parametrize only the tests that match specified markers or keywords, reducing collection time and resource consumption.
- **Customizable Filtering**: Easily adjust the filtering mechanism to suit different testing needs and configurations.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Focus computational resources on relevant tests, improving test execution speed and developer productivity.
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging to trace the parametrization process and identify tests that are included or excluded based on markers and keywords.

### Contents

- **`pytest_generate_tests` Hook**: A customized implementation of the `pytest_generate_tests` hook to optimize test parametrization.
- **Helper Functions**: Functions to evaluate expressions, check marker presence, and determine if tests should be skipped based on markers or keywords.
- **Examples and Usage**: Sample code and usage instructions to demonstrate how to integrate and use the optimized parametrization in your own pytest setup.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytest-optimized-parametrization.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have pytest installed. You can install it via pip if needed:
   ```sh
   pip install pytest
   ```

3. **Integrate the Custom Hook**: Add the provided `pytest_generate_tests` hook and helper functions to your pytest configuration.

4. **Run Tests with Markers**: Use markers to specify which tests to parametrize and run, leveraging the optimized filtering mechanism:
   ```sh
   pytest -m "your_marker"
   ```
